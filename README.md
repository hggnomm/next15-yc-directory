Sanity is a powerful, open-source content management system (CMS) that offers flexibility for managing, customizing, and scaling content for various projects. Known for its real-time editing capabilities and customizable backend, Sanity is an ideal choice for websites, blogs, and e-commerce platforms where content needs to be updated frequently.
